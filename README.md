# [Promise Tracker](https://promisetracker.codeforafrica.org)

**Promise Tracker**, is a tool to help journalists and civil society watchdogs more easily track campaign promises and other political / government pledges, using official evidence / data, as well as crowdsourced information, with a transparent and defensible methodology, to help inject accountability and honesty into the often cavalier way that promises are made to citizens to win their support for elections, policies, contracts â€¦ but are then seldom honoured.

## Installation

PromiseTracker is a single page [React](https://reactjs.org/) web app deployable to GitHub pages with little help from [spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages). See [package.json](./package.json) for the full list of dependencies and build & deploy scripts.
